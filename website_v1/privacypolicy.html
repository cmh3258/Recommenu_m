<h2>Last updated: 2/26/2014</h2>

<p>We at Recommenu, Inc. ("Recommenu," "we," "us," or "our") created this privacy policy ("Privacy Policy") because we know that you care about how information you provide to us is used and shared.  This Privacy Policy relates to the information collection and use practices of Recommenu in connection with our App. 

By accessing and using our App, you are agreeing to the terms of this Privacy Policy and the accompanying Terms of Use. If you do not agree to any of these terms, then please do not use the App. Capitalized terms not defined in this Privacy Policy shall have the meaning set forth in our Terms of Use.
</p>
<h2>Information We Collect   </h2>
<p>
We do not collect any personal information from you unless you voluntarily provide it to us. 

If you would like to use the App, you will need to download the App from the Apple App Store using your Apple credentials. If you link your Facebook or any other social media account with the App, you are authorizing Recommenu to collect, store, and use, in accordance with this Privacy Policy, any and all information that you agreed that Facebook, Inc. ("Facebook"), or such other social media company could provide to Recommenu through its Application Programming Interface ("API").  Such information may include, without limitation, your first and last name, username, profile picture, unique social media identifier and access token, and e-mail address.  In this Privacy Policy, we refer to this information as "Personal Information."

We may use third-party analytics technology to track and collect anonymous traffic data about the use of the App. This information includes information about the type of mobile device you are using, device model, operating system, App version, your IP addresses, browser type and language, referring and exit pages and URLs, date and time, amount of time spent on particular pages, what sections of the App you visit, and similar information that will help us analyze and evaluate how the App is used ("Usage Information"). The third-party technology providers may have access to your information only for the purposes of performing these tasks and on behalf of Recommenu and under obligations similar to those in this Privacy Policy.  

We do not collect Personal Information in this way, but if you've provided us with Personal Information we may associate that information with the information that is collected automatically. Automatic data collection may be performed on our behalf by our services providers. 
We may also allow third-party companies that are presenting advertisements on the App to set and access their own cookies.  Such third-party cookies are not governed by this Privacy Policy, but by the privacy policies of such third party. 

<h2>Information Collected through the App That IS NOT Covered by this Privacy Policy.</h2>
<p>
ANY VIEWS OR RECOMMENDATIONS THAT YOU POST THROUGH THE APP IS PUBLIC INFORMATION AND MAY BE SEEN, COLLECTED OR USED BY ANY OTHER REGISTERED USER OF THE APP. THIS PRIVACY POLICY DOES NOT APPLY TO SUCH INFORMATION, INCLUDING ANY PERSONAL INFORMATION CONTAINED THEREIN. 
</p>
<h2>How We Use Your Information.</h2>	

<p>We will use the Personal Information and Usage Information collected by the App for the following purposes:</p>
<ul>
<li>To respond to your requests and to provide you with the App;</li>
<li>To respond to your inquiries and contact you about changes to the App;</li>
<li>To send you notices (for example, in the form of e-mails, mailings, and the like) regarding products or services you are receiving, and for billing and collection purposes;</li>
<li>For any other purposes disclosed at the time the information is collected or to which you consent; and</li>
<li>As otherwise specifically described in this Privacy Policy.</li>
</ul>
<p>
We may also use your information to improve our App, and may use other information to enable us to customize your user experience.</p>  
<p>We may share your User Generated Content and your Personal Information with our business partners, including Restaurants. We are not responsible for the business partners' use of such information and their use of the information is not subject to this Privacy Policy.</p>

Please take care with the information, particularly any Personal Information, which you include in your User Generated Content.  </p>
<p>We, like many businesses, sometimes hire other companies to perform certain business-related functions.  Examples include mailing information, maintaining databases, hosting services, and processing payments.  When we employ another company to perform a function of this nature, we provide them with the information that they need to perform their specific function, which may include Personal Information.  We require such third parties to maintain the confidentiality of such information and use such information only as necessary to provide us with designated services.</p>
<p>If we or all or substantially all of our assets are acquired, we expect that the information that we have collected, including Personal Information, would be transferred along with our other business assets.</p>
<p>We may disclose your Personal Information and Usage Information to government authorities, and to other third parties when compelled to do so by government authorities, at our discretion, or otherwise as required by law, including but not limited to in response to court orders and subpoenas. We also may disclose your Personal Information and Usage Information when we have reason to believe that someone is or may be causing injury to or interference with our rights or property, other users of this App, or anyone else that could be harmed by such activities.</p>
